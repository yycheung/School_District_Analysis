Taverage reaing score is also lowered but since we round the number one decimal place which seems unchange, we can see the change in percentage of passing reading, which is lowered by 0.1 point. And the percentage of passing both math and reading is also lowered by 0.3 point to 64.9. These change shows that the reading and math score of 9th graders in Thomas High School is relatively high in original record compare to others.

Since we just excluded the 9th graders' performance in Thomas High School, only numbers in the row of "Thomas High School" might change, so we only retrieve the image showing Thomas High School Summary. The average math score in Thomas High School is slightly lowered from 83.418349 to 83.350937, dropped 0.08%, thus the percentage of passing math is also dropped from 93.2722% to 93.1857%. However, the reading score is slightly increased from 83.848930 to 83.896082, 0.056% increment. But the precentage of reading dropps from 97.3089% to 97.01874%. Thus, the overall passing percentage dropps 90.948012% to 90.630324%. 

In other words, replacing the ninth gradersâ€™ math and reading scores results in a slightly lower average math score, slightly lower math passing rate, slightly lower reading passing rate and slightly lower the overall passing rate.
